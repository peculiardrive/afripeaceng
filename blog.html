.<div>By Edison Okereke</div></h4>

                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><br>"... you see the trouble we are in, come and let us build...that we will no longer suffer disgrace...." (Nehemiah 2:17).<br>Recently, the News Agency of Nigeria, NAN, in a news bulletin, reported the increasing rate of cultism in secondary schools in Asaba, Delta State. (The scourge is not peculiar to the state).<br>The report was an investigative journalistic effort by a female journalist entitled, "Cultism: Journalist alerts on increasing involvement of females", highlighted on the front-page of Daily Nigerian Horn of Monday, November 26, 2018. <br>According to the report, a broadcaster and social journalist, Ms Ejiro Umukoro, has alerted parents in the South South of the increasing rate of FEMALE involvement in cultism in various schools in the region. Emphasis mine.<br>In the report tagged: "GIME: Getting Inside Me Project," was made available to NAN on Sunday, November 26, 2018.<br>She stated that Delta State was currently faced with high increased rate of female cultism recruitment such that most of the school authorities have testified to the ugly development.<br>According to her some of the girls involved in the cultism who spoke with her wanted to leave the cult were between the ages of 11 and 15 years.<br>"There are over nine female gangs in Asaba alone, with many others unknown. These nine are the most dominant groups with many of them created as the female arm of existing male-dominated gangs and secret cults," Umukoro stated.<br>According to the revelation, they included: TG Girls (Tiger Girls), ViceQueen (Vipers), F-Tibi (Future Tibi), White Angels JBC-Junior Vikings), Pink Lady (Apache) Red Devils, Bad Dragon, Blue Birds and Red Sea.<br>The report says these groups run on registration fee of between N2000 and N5000, and weekly dues of N200 and/or N400, meaning they are properly and well constituted.<br>Some teachers spoken to by the journalist admitted that a lot of cult activities were invading the secondary schools.<br>The development, the report says, has led some school counsellors in the region  to call parents to wake up to the revelations and watch their children. <br>Umukoro noted that the students were exposed to drugs, sexual abuse and other social vices from peer pressure.<br>This is not the first time we have read or heard secondary or primary school students or pupils engaging themselves in cultism. The fact that they are females makes it more worrisome. Or is it in line with the saying that whatever a man can do a woman can do it better?<br>Umukoro's report can be looked at in three ways. <br>First, some of the members of the cultism are now seriously calling for help out of the bondage.<br>Second, some school authorities there said they were aware of the development.<br>And third, Umukoro herself has called on parents and other stakeholders to take part in the fight against cultism in society. <br>She urged parents to be more attentive and develop a healthy relationship with their children, adding that parents have a major role to play in helping the kids abstain from such associations and also help the kids to renounce such gangs.<br>Apart from the peer group influence it is inexplicable for a child of 11 to 15 years of age to join any group whose activities are inimical to his career, society's growth and development. In the first instance, the children in this age brackets are not in economic pressure from the family whatsoever. But this a vital age in the growth of a young man or woman. <br>"This is when the hormones in a youth start 'jangling'" according to Dr. John Knight in his book, "Everything A Teenage Boy Should Know". The book has the female version. This age is crucial.<br>That is where the activities and orientation of Professor Ernest E. Uwazie's Afripeace and Sustainable Development Foundation Initiative in Imo State comes to bear. <br>The non-governmental organization (NGO) takes it upon itself to train and chaperon young secondary school students on the need to thread on the part of PEACE at all times. In other to achieve the noble objectives the foundation organizes peace clubs at this level of education and this has to a large extent reduced cult activities in the schools that have keyed into the formations. The clubs engage in so many sociable activities through regular seminars and workshops put in place by the foundation. <br>Many students have embraced the ideals and moving steadily in their careers, and many schools in Imo State have embraced it too. Uwazie did not stop there.<br>He also built a skills acquisition centre, SAC, worth over N8.5m and donated same to the Imo State Government for the advantages of the students to acquire certain skills, promising to equip it with computers.<br>The Imo State Executive Secretary of Secondary School Management Board (SEMB), chief C. O. E. Chukwu (Ohamadike) described the exercise and gesture as "a revolution".<br>After watching the great performance of members of the club during their closing ceremonies on Friday, August 17, 2018, at the Comprehensive Secondary School Umuezeala-Ogwara (CSSUO) headquarters of the foundation in Ehime Mbano LGA,  Imo State, said: "...Professor Uwazie, you are wonderful for thinking positively for the development of our motherland...."<br>Chief Chukwu was on the occasion to represent the state commissioner for Primary and Secondary Education, Prof. Mrs Florence Chigozie Emenalo.<br>The same theory of skills on education is being canvassed by Society For 'Nigeria Entrepreneurship Education Development (SNEED) said much the same thing at its formal inauguration Project Exhibition in Owerri, on July 31, 2018, at Government Secondary School.<br>Luckily, most teachers and students attended the ceremony during which some talented students were honoured.<br>In an address, the president of the society, Prof. Ikechukwu Abonyi stated: "You may recall that in the pre-Civil War era the Nigerian economy was sustained by our collective resourcefulness and entrepreneurship. With the discovery of oil and the oil boom the emphasis on skills acquisition and entrepreneurship for sustainable development began to wane. Subsequently, as the economy became dependent on oil revenue, unemployment began to soar higher and higher with the depreciation of the nation's per capita income. Finally, we found ourselves where we are today -recession, unemployment, poverty with the accompanying social vices."<br>Prof. Abonyi further stated, "After a thorough analysis of the deplorable situation and realising that as things stand in our present Nigeria, there is no light at the end of the tunnel SNEED decided to take the bull by the horns  which is in tandem with the new education curriculum adopted by the Nigerian Educational Research and Development Council (NERDC). Consequently, the basic features of the New Senior Secondary Education Curriculum provide the introduction of ICT, civic education, and trade/entrepreneurship as compulsory cross cutting core subjects...."<br>One of the objectives of SNEED is: "To help teachers keep abreast with trends in entrepreneurship education and its applications." I am yet to see the majority of the teachers manifesting this in their activities. Most teachers of nowadays are fifty per cent teachers and fifty per cent traders due to poor remuneration and often due to lack of training in the required skills. Most teachers do not possess the skills. The popular handiwork in schools during which pupils and students showcase their little skills has been converted to a funding raising. Money is now used instead.<br>And the government is not helping matters either. When will our government match its policies with effective implementation? and  in this wise reduce crime occasioned by these problems that lead students to temptations. The answer, of course, lies in the effective implication of the 6-3-3-4 System of education. The teacher should be trained to cue into the programme too.<br>In a keynote address marking the 1st Annual Memorial Lectures of a social activist, Barrister Nnanna Iwuagwu, at Amauzari in Isiala Mbano LGA, the guest lecturer, Ag. Dean, Student Affairs, Hezekiah University Umudi in Imo State, Chidi C. Ukagu, PhD, on Thursday, November 29, 2018, related a recent shocking story in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. According to him, " a fortnight ago, two men alleged to be cult members, were gruesomely beheaded in Choba by a rival group."<br>To avoid being victims of all these,  Dr. Ukagu called on the youth to have healthy ambitions and pursue them zealously. In a chat with Ukagu we agreed on the need to match theories with practicals in the 21st education of Nigeria.<br>The import of these stories is that the students of secondary schools should now be engaged positively and meaningfully in skills acquisition, especially now that the white collar jobs are no longer readily available. I don't know why the Governments both state and federal are not taking the issue of the skills seriously as a way of an escape from the challenges of unemployment by inculcating skills into the 'idle' students.<br>As important as the peace education engagement is some officials of the Government Secondary School, Owerri yet demanded for tips before they could allow the peace club to be continued there after it had run for some years there and had kept the students busy. When the tips were not forthcoming the programme was stopped. <br>That notwithstanding, the clubs are still going on in other schools in the state. And the efforts witnessed a tremendous success during the close of its 2018 five-day activities. It is surprising that the Parents-Teachers Association, PTA, of the Government Secondary School did not intervene nor  ask questions about the reasons for stopping it.<br>Unless the students are kept busy with some activities in the schools they are bound to fall astray as we all know that an idle mind is a devil's workshop.<br>The Igbo say: "Aga ahu nke emere eme nke ahuru." This surely plays out in such situations. It has a similar connotation with an idle mind being a devil's workshop.<br>The necessity of integrating or accompanying skills with theoretical education cannot be overemphasized. <br>My cousin's son, Nkwachukwu, while in class two or so in secondary school, was encouraged by the father to enrol in a tailoring trade (or fashion designing). Now he has completed both secondary education and the trade, and planning to further his education either in the university or polytechnic.<br>Uzochukwu who is almost an expert in bricklaying is now a sophomore or in second year in his unrelated bricklaying course in Anambra Polytechnic, Oko. He can now handle any housebuilding job. He has worked for me. His level of skill is encouraging. He is the one training himself in school. I know both parents. It does not seem to them their child is in a tertiary institution.<br>That is the sense of combining education with a skill. It is superb. The beauty is in the course of the young men's schooling they have not been involved in any anti-social behaviour because they have no time for such frivolities.<br>I suppose the idea behind the introduction of the 6-3-3-4 System of Education is to impart skills in the youth such that within the first nine years in the education system the student can fall back on some skill. <br>The failure of the beautiful education policy is due to its inadequacy.<br>There were no properly trained teachers or tutors for the programme. A country like Nigeria with its numerous corrupt political leaders who pay lip service to job creation ought to fashion out a skill-oriented academic programme for its school system.<br>For more than twelve years in Imo State there have not been any major employment recruitment. The Ikedi Ohakim Administration employed 'ten' thousand graduates. The number was not really up to that. But it would have helped, any way if the beneficiaries had been retained. Rochas Okorocha administration came and sacked us (I was a beneficiary of the jobs). So, all the graduates of this or that institution in the state are somewhat 'idle' now except those who have availed themselves of one skillful trade or the other. The situation is getting to an alarming level. The police cells are daily filled to their brims due to avoidable crime that ought to have been taken care of with good education policies in place. It is unfortunate indeed.<br>Then, what to do for the helpless trapped female students in Asaba and elsewhere. The Delta State Government should hasten up and rescue the girls calling on the authorities for help. It is possible that most of them were forced under serious circumstances to join the groups. <br>No doubt the girls are now remorseful and should be rescued with despatch. These ones should be used to fish out their leaders with a view to rehabilitating all of them.<br>The Save-Our-Souls calls by these entrapped girls will humanize or dehumanize them depending on how  urgently the calls are heeded to. <br>And if the girlish cultism is not handled with the urgency that it requires now its activities, like those of the insurgents in the country will be difficult to curb. Now, imagine how many of these cult groups that will metamorphose into the likes of Boko Haram, ISIS or any other dangerous groups?<br>Other states, especially Imo, Anambra, Enugu, Ebonyi, Abia should seriously monitor the activities of their students in their various schools from time to time irrespective of whether they are government- or privately-owned with a view to eradicating any unusual activities by these cult groups because of their proximity with Delta State. All hands must, of course, be on deck by all and sundry to discourage this dangerous phenomenon before it gets out of hand like any other problems in the country. Without being checked the involvement of teenage girls in cultism must spell doom for the country. <br>Again, parents, especially those involved in politics as a profession, should pay close attention to their children from time to time to know what their children and wards are doing, especially now that the political tempo is increasing. Who will you blame if in the course of chasing political leadership the children on whose behalf you are struggling become touts and miscreants in society? What shall it profit you?<br>In the words of Ms Umukoro, "Children who are forced to join cults can get out by signing an Affidavit at the Magistrate's court and take same to the state Anti-Cult Unit, which now enables them to sign a renunciation certificate." I suppose this obtains in other states of the federation too including Imo?</p>
